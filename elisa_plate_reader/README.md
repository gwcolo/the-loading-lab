# ðŸš§ Under Construction

This section of **The Loading Lab** is not ready yet.  
The plan is to add a quick demo for this data type here (load â†’ peek â†’ 2â€“3 simple plots).  

## Why it's empty
The goal of The Loading Lab is to give you **first-touch notebooks** for many common bioinformatics data types.  
Some folders are still being scaffolded â€” Iâ€™ll be filling them in as I go.

## What to expect once complete
- An `environment.yml` with minimal dependencies  
- A `notebooks/` folder with 1â€“2 simple Jupyter notebooks  
- A `data/` folder (empty, gitignored) with pointers to public datasets  
- This README updated with links + quickstart instructions  

---

ðŸ‘‰ In the meantime, check the [main README](../README.md) for modules that are already working!
